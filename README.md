# Mathematical-Stability-of-Foam
This repository contains my bachelor's thesis in Fluid Dynamics, focusing on mathematical models for the stability of foam lamellae during drainage. 

The .pdf file with the thesis is self contained (with code in the appendix), but the MATLAB files used to generate some of the numerical solutions are also given separately.
